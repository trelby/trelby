-pml->pdf font baseline wrong for non-courier fonts?

-move some/all of GlobalData/MyPanel/MyCtrl/MyFrame out of trelby.py

-version information needs to be updated in way too many places. figure
 out a way to have it in as few places as possible so it's easier to
 update. currently it must be updated in:

  -misc.py
  -install.nsi
  -debian/changelog
  -doc/version.xml

-try using graphics contexts for tab ctrl drawing to get anti-aliased
 lines (http://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_graphics_context.html)

other:

  -remove confirmation dialogs for deleting stuff, and their associated
   config options

  -update manual (document undo, remove delete confirmation settings, ...)

  -applyCfg: clear undo history

  -emacs-like behavior while in middle of undo history; keeps us from ever
   losing any history

  -implement undo history trimming (estimate memory usage of each item,
   and cap used memory at X)

  -write unit tests

    -modify t_random.py to test that each operation can be undone/redone
     and script contents are exactly the same

    -randomly do undo/redo
