-pml->pdf font baseline wrong for non-courier fonts?

-move some/all of GlobalData/MyPanel/MyCtrl/MyFrame out of trelby.py

-version information needs to be updated in way too many places. figure
 out a way to have it in as few places as possible so it's easier to
 update. currently it must be updated in:

  -misc.py
  -install.nsi
  -debian/changelog
  -doc/version.xml

-try using graphics contexts for tab ctrl drawing to get anti-aliased
 lines (http://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_graphics_context.html)


UNDO/REDO
=========

action                type
------                ------

done:

delete-elem-types     FullCopy
addChar               SinglePara (possibly merged)
  charmap
  namesdlg
spellcheckerdlg       SinglePara
find-and-replace      SinglePara
NewElement            ManyElems(1, 2)
Tab (end of elem)     ManyElems(1, 2)
Tab (middle of elem)  ManyElems(1, 1)
TabPrev               ManyElems(1, 1)
insertForcedLineBreak ManyElems(1, 1)

remaining:

delete                1-2 elems
deleteBackward        1-2 elems
change-to-X           1-N elems
cut                   1-N elems
paste                 1-N elems
pasteSystemCB         1-N elems


other:

  -doing undo/redo must clear auto-comp (and any other state we may have)

  -remove confirmation dialogs for deleting stuff, and their associated
   config options

  -update manual (document undo, remove delete confirmation settings, ...)

  -applyCfg: clear undo history

  -emacs-like behavior while in middle of undo history; keeps us from ever
   losing any history

  -implement undo history trimming (estimate memory usage of each item,
   and cap used memory at X)

  -write unit tests

    -modify t_random.py to test that each operation can be undone/redone
     and script contents are exactly the same

    -randomly do undo/redo
